            <p>Hello! My name is George and I am a web developer in training. I currently work in a flower shop in Manhattan and do freelance graphic design on the side. I have a bachelors degree in art with a concentration in digital media. I am currently working to expand my digital porfolio to include web design.</p>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy drawing, reading and playing video games. Thank you for taking the time to check out my webpage. I am now writing things down just to make filler content on the page. There is no other useful information past this point. If you are still reading this, then you are wasting your time. I know there's a tool that generates random latin to have this effect. I don't care. This is how I am doing it. If you don't like it, then you should have stopped reading when I told you to.</p>
